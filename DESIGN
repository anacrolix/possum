See manifest.sql for the manifest DB schema.

DB instance are identified by their dir path.

DB instance clients have:
	* A lazily created exclusive file for writing new values to the DB.
	* A sqlite3 connection to the manifest file.
	* One or more snapshots?

A snapshot has:
	* One or more cloned value files.

write values for keys:
	* append to exclusive file
	* hash parts?
	* take exclusive write lock on manifest
	* add entries, punching blocks from new writes that are duplicates
	* evict and punch holes until size below max

for a read:
	* open manifest for immediate write
	* look up value parts that overlap with the intended read region
	* perform any possible immediate reads (not all the value is guaranteed to be available)
	* update the last_used for blocks that were read
	* clone any files that contain regions to be streamed out
	* return snapshots

when a snapshot is closed:
	drop ref to cloned value files, deleting on the last one (or maybe they're anonymous to begin with, unlinked after the clone completes)

when evicting:
	while manifest page_count*page_size + sum(block_length) from blocks >= capacity:
		* walk blocks in order of bytes used, last used:
			* if there are enough consecutively non-full blocks that could be merged efficiently:
				* write the active parts of each block:
					* update the block locations
					* punch out the block source location
			* punch unused full blocks:
				* delete value parts referencing the blocks

how to do a singleflight fetch for a missing item:
	* open manifest
	* see a key is in an undesired state
	* write a tag with an timestamp of when a fetch was started
	* unlock manifest
	* perform the fetch
	* do a write, and clear the fetch state

advantages:
	* you can bring your own files to the cache in their entirety and then have them punched out by the implementation as they decay in usefulness.

On Windows, file cloning appears to be possible with https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-fsctl_duplicate_extents_to_file. The destination file is opened, then the regions of the source file are specified and the clone occurs. It might not be available on NTFS.

For filesystems where cloning is not supported, it should be possible to "fall back" to synchronously reading while a transaction is open, or providing an API to copy out or lock values more efficiently than is usually available.

Here's a list of support https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/file-cloning.html.
