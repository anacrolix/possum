 * Add an integrity check for a directory that includes:
    * Removing unused values files.
    * Vacuuming the manifest file?
 * Add hinting for value alignment (I'm sure there's some equation that determines if it's likely to be worthwhile to align a value. Possibly 2048, 4096 or 8192 would be appropriate for a 4096 block size?
 * Is greedy end possible? If a value exists above the region we're punching out, then we can extend up too.
 * Add a --fragments option to missing holes detection.
